## (Pas sûr que ce soit une bonne idée de commencer en parlant des Poincaré pour justifier qu'on a observé du chaos. Tant qu'à moi, c'est vraiment la manifestation la moins évidente... Mais c'est bien d'en parler évidemment)
We were able to replicate the chaotic behaviour displayed by the model of Hastings and Powell. Indeed, the Poincaré sections (fig. 4 (a, c)) plotted (x,y) coordinates of points of the phase plots that theoretically coincided with the plane in the "handle" of the teacup-shaped diagrams. The Poincaré sections being almost unidimensional, we considered, as explained in the original paper, a single variable within our Poincaré maps (fig. 4 (b, d)). The slopes of these latter graphs denoted chaos, as specified by Hastings and Powell. The effect of initial conditions on the diverging trajectories of the model (fig. 2), its unending cycles (fig. 1), and the existence of the bifurcation diagrams (fig. 3) were also indicators of chaos.
## (replace by) We were able to replicate the chaotic behaviour displayed by Hastings & Powell's model. The resulting behavior is indeed very sensible to the initial conditions, showing increasingly diverging trajectories (fig 2.) for slightly different parameters, as well as unending oscillations (fig 1.). The bifurcation diagrams (fig. 3) further confirm the existence of chaos by illustrating the presence of limit cycle behavior for some values and chaotic intervals for others, hence extreme sensibility of the system to $b_1$ values. As for the Poincaré sections (fig. 4 (a, c)), they plotted (x,y) coordinates of points of the phase plots that theoretically coincided with the plane in the "handle" of the teacup-shaped diagrams. The Poincaré sections being almost unidimensional, we considered, as explained in the original paper, a single variable within our Poincaré maps (fig. 4 (b, d)). The slopes of these latter graphs therefore also denoted chaos, as specified by Hastings and Powell.
##Elo agrees with this modification!

As mentioned earlier, the difference between our fig. 1 and fig. 2 and Hastings & Powell's original ones do not alter the results interpretation. Without the exact same initial conditions, such difference is to be expected with a system exhibiting chaotic behavior.
## Nécessaire de répéter? ou d'ajouter autre chose? J'ajouterai peut-être un petit truc et ça donnerait ça:
For figures 1a, 1b, 1c and 2, the shape of the cycles and oscillations are similar to Hastings and Powell's. As mentioned earlier, the slightly differences  are due to the fact that we surely didn't use the exact same initial conditions. Such difference is to be expected with a system exhibiting chaotic behavior and do not alter the results interpretation.

## Sûrement trop long, je ne sais pas vraiment quoi dire à part spéculer
The difference between our fig. 3 and Hastings & Powell's bifurcation diagram is more intriguing. Admittedly, we could not figure out exactly what Hastings & Powell's method was, and some elements such as identifying maxima values by increasing $b_1$ first, then by decreasing it, did not make sense to us. Our method should be appropriate, theoretically, to select only values that are primary local maxima, and it did seem to work very well for most values; yet, the broad range of values at $b_1$ = 3.1 that we observed instead of a dichotomy is hard to explain. It seems unlikely that the problem could be related to our arbitrary threshold of 66% or to our identification of a local maximum, because we would then be either missing some lower values or having too many, not having more in between. The timeseries of all values of $z$ (not presented here) for $b_1$ = 3.1 confirms that there are "intermediate" maxima values, which should be selected by any proper method. We suggest that the difference might be due to the algorithms used for the numerical integration in our two studies. It is possible that the relationship between the parameters at this point is such that a small difference in algorithm might have an important impact. It is also possible that their algorithm came up with an unstable solution and a system that did not reach cycling behavior, such as ours for certain values past $b_1$ = 5.01, but that Hastings & Powell's method selected some values anyways, explaining the behavior at $b_1$ = 3.1. ## N'explique pas le gap à 2.35, mais il y a des valeurs sur la figure 4a, c'est juste sur la 4c qu'il en manque. Pour moi c'est une affaire de qualité de l'image rendu là...

While we also found chaos for values of $b_2$ other than the default one of 2.0, both smaller or greater, we do not totally agree with Hastings & Powell that "chaos is more likely for larger values of $b_2$". As fig. S1 and S2 shows, chaos can be quite likely for both smaller or larger values. We find important to note, however, that at a certain value of $b_2$, $z$ converges and starts to crash, thus exhibiting non chaotic behavior within a certain range of $b_1$ values. This crash is to be expected when looking at the original dimensional parameters, so it is possible that Hastings & Powell simply chose not to reach this limit in their analyses, as they were only interested in biologically reasonable parameters, likely with the three species present.

We believe that our mixed results in attempting to replicate fig. 4 came from the algorithm we used to identify the points that coincided with the plane. We indeed specified a tolerance value (epsilon), which defined a region under and above the plane. The region was also defined by manually chosen values of x and y, which allowed us to target the "handles" of the phase plots. We kept the points that were inside the region and plotted them as needed in order to form our Poincaré sections and maps. Although we were able to precisely replicate the Poincaré sections for b1 = 3.0 (fig. 4 (a)) and 6.0 (fig. 4 (c)), the Poincaré maps need some refinement. For b1 = 3.0 (fig. 4 (b)), it lacked some points of the phase plots and included others that were closed yet non-coincident with the plane. For b1 = 6.0 (fig. 4 (d)), the discrepancy was more obvious, and might be due to the more chaotic behaviour of the system under this parameter, observed for instance from the larger width of its "handle" (compare axis intervals of fig. 4 (a, c)). We are still working on improving our algorithms to adequately replicate Hastings and Powell's Poincaré maps.

# Conclusion ## (vraiment pas sûr, c'est une suggestion) Elo: j'ai tourné cela un peu plus critique si ça vous convient
We have succeeded in replicating Hastings & Powell's model and its main findings, as our results confirm chaos arising in a three species food chain in continuous time. In general, the model including its equations and parameters was well described by the authors. The most significant flaw of Hastings & Powell's paper in terms of replication was the absence of the initial conditions which have a huge impact on a chaotic system and the insufficient description of certain methods. Consequently, there are slight differences between our results and theirs. Furthermore, since we tried to keep our implementation as close as possible to the original one, some steps did rely on arbitrary thresholds (the primary local maxima or the Poincaré boundaries for instance). Hence, it is somewhat less flexible and possibly could not be applied to a broader range of parameter values. We suggest that an interesting step would be to train machine-learning algorithms, such as neural networks, to identify chaotic behavior and its boundaries, in order to obtain an even better performing implementation.
