One of the main aspects of a biological community is its food web. The first models of population dynamics generally considered the interactions between only two species (e. g., Canale, 1970; Rosenzweig & MacArthur, 1963). However, in nature, food webs of only two species that influence alone the behavior of the ecological network are quite uncommon. Most of the time, they are way more complex and involve more than two species (Hastings & Powell, 1991). In that regard, some researchers stated that every food webs study should involve at least three species in order to not lose too much information (Price *et al*., 1980; Rosenzweig, 1973).

At first, the principal interest of food webs researchers was related to equilibrium analysis because they assumed that what was observed in nature was the equilibrium state of dynamics models. Thereafter, different studies declared that chaos played an important role in ecological models. The simplest definition of chaos would be the extreme sensibility of the system to its initial conditions in its resulting behavior (Hasting *et al*., 1993). This concept has been incorporated in population dynamics during the mid-1970's. Since then, many papers reinforced the importance of chaos in ecology.

Hastings & Powell (1991), who studied chaos in a continuous time model of a food web including three species, contributed considerably to the significance and understanding of this subject. Considering every aspect of their model, their pioneer study leaded to a lot of other papers on food webs dynamics and chaos (Brose *et al*., 2006; Gakkhar & Singh, 2011). Replicating this kind of paper is important for many reasons. For example, we can compare our results, obtained using current technologies, with theirs and make available the code written to recreate the model. In the current paper, we used the same equations and parameters values as Hastings & Powell to replicate their model. We were able to reproduce all the figures in their paper using *Julia v1.1.0*.
