When studying a community, one of the principal elements to consider is its food web. The first models that studied population dynamics were generally considering the interactions between only two species (e. g., Canale 1970; Rosenzweig & MacArthur 1963). However, in nature, food webs that only include two species and whose behavior only depends on these two are quite uncommon. Most of the time, they are way more complex and involve more than two species (Hastings & Powell, 1991). In that regard, some researchers stated that any food webs study should involve at least three species in order not to lose too much information (Price *et al*., 1980; Rosenzweig, 1973).

At first, researchers concentrated their food webs works on equilibrium analysis because they assumed that what was observed in nature was the equilibrium state of dynamics models. Thereafter, different studies declared that chaos plays an important role in ecological models. The simplest definition of chaos would be the extreme sensibility to initial conditions in the resulting behavior of a model (Hasting *et al*. 1993). This concept has been incorporated in population dynamics during the mid-1970's. Since then, many papers reinforced the importance of chaos in ecology.

Hastings & Powell (1991), who studied chaos in a continuous time model including three species,  contributed considerably to the significance and understanding of this subject.  Considering all the aspects of their model, it leaded to a lot of other studies on food webs dynamics and chaos (Brose *et al*., 2006; Gakkhar & Singh, 2011). The idea of replicating this kind of paper is important for many reasons. For example, we can compare our results using current technologies with theirs and make available the code used to create the model. In the current paper, we used the same equations and parameters values as Hastings & Powell to replicate their model. We were able to reproduce all the figures in their paper using *Julia v1.1.0*.
