# [Re] Chaos in a Three-Species Food Chain
## 2019 Replication of Hastings & Powell (1991)

This project is a replication and implementation in *Julia v1.3.1* of Hastings & Powell (1991), a classic paper in ecological modelling. Full reference to the original article:

> Hastings, A., & Powell, T. (1991). Chaos in a Three-Species Food Chain. Ecology, 72(3), 896â€“903. https://doi.org/10.2307/1940591

The goal of this project was to test if the results of the original paper could be reproduced, as well as to provide a fully reproducible version for it on GitHub.

### Model reproduction

All the scripts required are in the `code/` subfolder and assume that `code/` is used as the working directory. To reproduce our project, we recommend the following steps as initial setup, assuming *Julia* is already installed and a UNIX-like terminal is used:
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/BIO6032/2019_replication_HastingsPowell_1991.git
```
2. Launch *Julia* in the `code/` subfolder
```
cd code/
julia
```
3. Run the following command to install the exact versions of packages (as specified in the Project Environment)
```
]instantiate
```

`main.jl` can then be run to reproduce all figures. Alternatively, individual scripts in `code/` can be run interactively after running lines 1-15 of `main.jl`.

### Article on reproduction attempt

Our article can also be reproduced using our `Makefile`. It requires `pandoc`, `pandoc-crossref` and `pandoc-citeproc`. Just run the following in a terminal:
```
make
```
or
```
make article.pdf
```
